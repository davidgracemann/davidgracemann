## Domains

| Domains Of Focus | What I do | Status / Notes | 
|---|---|---|
| Computer & Systems Engineering (Research) | Academic research aligned with my Master’s program at TU Ilmenau. | Active 🟢 ( Academia ) |
| AI (Foundational + Applied) | Proof-of-designs, implementations, and applied research with rigorous evaluation where possible. | Active  🟢 ( Core Focus Domain )|
| Quant + High-Performance Computing | Performance-first engineering, low-latency systems, numerical methods, execution-grade infrastructure . | Active  🟢 ( Honestly I need to eat and pay rent ) |
| Legacy Fintech / BankOps | Maintenance-only support for older open-source contributions from earlier work. | Maintenance-only 🟡 ( For Old Time's Sake )|
> I have pivoted to **personal research**. No new Fintech/BankOps feature work is planned (maintenance-only).


## Upcoming Updates & Projects

### A. Infrastructure Updates (BankOps Hardening)

Focusing on transitioning existing "BankOps" systems from standard microservices to formal, event-sourced architectures with enterprise-grade rigor.

| Project | Current State | Hardening Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FlossPay** | Payment Aggregator | Implementing L4 circuit-breaking and DLQ patterns for PCI-DSS compliant fault tolerance. |
| **Flossx83** | ISO 8583 Simulator | Integrating HSM-grade AES256 tokenization and RLT Fraud Detection via ML microservices. |
| **Recon-Engine** | Distributed Recon | Upgrading to an event-sourced architecture with hash-collision detection for 99.5% auto-recon. |

---

### B. Proof of Concept & Design (AI Research)

Advancing domain-specific AI models through fine-tuning and mathematical primitive research.

| POC Name | Research Focus | Technical Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IRSIE** | SLM for Tax Jurisprudence | Fine-tuning a 12-layer transformer on 2.8B tokens with RLHF-tuned deterministic validation. |
| **Qaml** | Mathematical Transformers | Training a 65M-parameter model from first principles for sub-50ms suspicious pattern detection. |

---

### C. New Projects ( POCD - Pending )

Pioneering projects at the intersection of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Systems Engineering for your upcoming research at TU Ilmenau.

| Project Title | Category | Strategic Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Preemptive Threat Agent** | **Applied AI #2** | Architecting an autonomous agentic framework for defense simulations via Stochastic Manifold Analysis. |
| **Graceman Graph-Map** | **Theoretical CS #1** | Formal verification of self-healing software states using TLA+ and recursive graph mapping. |
